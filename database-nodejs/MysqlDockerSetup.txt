1. install mysql docker image

    docker run --name ms  -p 3306:3306 (port forwarding from host:3306 to docker container 3306) -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql     (aquire terminal)
    
    docker run -d --name ms -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql  (deattach from terminal)

    --name  
        => name of mysql container

    -p  <port1>:<port2>
        => port1 is the host port
        => port2 is the docker container port
        => port2  of docker container is mapped to port1 of host machine
            if will connect from localhost to localhost:3306 then requests will be mapped to 3306 of docker
            if we want to connect from remote server, we can make connection to <Host IP>:3306. requests will be resent to 3306 of docker container


2. Check if it is running

    docker ps

3. if docker image installed and mysql is not running currently, to start mysql 

    docker start ms (docker container name)

4. To start a interactive mysql terminal

    a. get interactive terminal to docker container

        docker exec -it ms bash     
    
    2. connect to mysql 

        mysql -u root -p
